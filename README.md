## My First React.js Project! ðŸŽ‰

### A simple yet functional React app that lets users sort products based on price (including ranges like $380-410).

## ðŸ§© What I Learned:

#### ðŸŒ¿ JSX & Babel: Writing HTML-like code inside JavaScript using JSX, and understanding how Babel compiles it behind the scenes.

#### ðŸŒ¿ Module Bundlers: Used Parcel for bundling my project efficiently â€” it made the development workflow smooth and fast.

#### ðŸŒ¿ React Hooks: Leveraged useState() for clean and reactive UI state management instead of manipulating the DOM manually.

#### ðŸŒ¿ Modular Code: Understood how to organize code better using import/export across JS files.

#### ðŸŒ¿ Dependencies vs DevDependencies: Now I know the difference â€” and why it matters during build vs deployment.
